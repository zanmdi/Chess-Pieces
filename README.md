# Chess-Pieces
This repository provides a C++ implementation of chess pieces, with each piece as a separate class for easy integration into larger chess projects. It includes basic functionalities like movement rules and capturing logic, designed for extensibility and customization. This serves as a foundational component for complex chess applications.


# Test the code

To test the code add the following two samples in the test.cpp file.
```chess
1. d2-d4 f7-f5
2. Bf1-h3 Rh8xh2
```
The expected results should be:
```chess
1.valid valid
2.invalid invalid
```
